# Bubble sort
Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an array with n number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.
# Pros: 
 • simple to write <br/>
 • easy to understand <br/>
 • takes a few lines of code
# Cons: 
 • very slow and runs in O(n^2) time in worst as well as average case. <br/>
  (more items being sorted, the less efficient it is)
<br/>
<br/>
Complexity : O(n^2)
