# Bubble sort
Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of n elements provided in form of an array with n number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values.

# Pros:
 • Simple to write
 • Easy to understand
 • Takes a few lines of code
# Cons: 
 • Very slow because runs in O(n^2) time (More items being sorted, the less efficient it is)
